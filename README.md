# Sobel-Operator-Edge-Detection
Sobel Operator Implementation: Analyzing Image Edges and Gradients with Enhanced Precision

It is a program that implements the 3 × 3 Sobel operators. The input image is “building.raw”. The output images are: 1) the result of applying Gx; 2) the result of applying Gy; 3) the gradient [Gx2+Gy2]0.5; and 4) the edge map with threshold TE = 128.

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
